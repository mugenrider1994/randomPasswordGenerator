# Random Password Generator

## Motivation

The Challenge3 Random Password Generator was developed to expand the author's skillset with JavaScript. The author successfully implemented prompts to gather user input for customizing the criteria for a random password generator. They also worked on if statements and for loops to ensure that each character chosen is an option for generating a randomized password.

## Description

The Challenge3 Random Password Generator is a web-based application that allows users to generate a random password based on their specified criteria. When the application is loaded, the user will be prompted to choose the following criteria:

- Password length between 8 and 128 characters.
- Inclusion of uppercase letters.
- Inclusion of lowercase letters.
- Inclusion of special characters.
- Inclusion of numbers.

Once the user has provided their preferences through the prompts, the application will generate a random password that adheres to the chosen criteria. The generated password will be displayed in the text box for the user to copy and use as needed.

## How to Use

1. Open the webpage for the Challenge3 Random Password Generator.
2. Click the "Generate Password" button to initiate the password generation process.
3. Follow the prompts to specify your desired password criteria.
4. After answering all prompts, a random password will be generated and displayed in the text box.
5. You can copy the generated password and use it as required.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. One potential improvement could be the addition of while loops to enforce that only 'y' or 'n' are accepted as valid inputs for the prompts. This would ensure that users can only provide appropriate responses, leading to a better user experience.
